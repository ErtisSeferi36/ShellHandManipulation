This application can be lled and run by doing the following:

........


This application supports the following gestures:

Index and middle finger up: Open google in the system's default browser
Thumb and pink up : Take a screenshot
Index finger and pinky up : Close selected program (Alt + F4)
Index, middle, and ring finger up : Close the current browser tab
Middle finger: [CENSORED]

All five fingers out : Activate mouse tracking

  While in mouse mode:
  Putting the index finger down in this mode will act as a click.
  Fist (all fingers down) : Exit mouse tracking mode.


The program can be stopped by entering "Ctrl + C" on the console or "Esc" on the camera vision window.

The mouse tracking tracks "Index finger mcp" as depicted in "THE HAND.png"

a finger is considered down if the corresponding "dip" is closer to the wrist than the "pip" as described by THE HAND


Failures:
Not many to speak of, we experimented with a couple of mouse options, but found one we liked in win32

Successes:
Using numpy and some quick math to easily and quickly determine whether a finger is "up" or not

Improvements:
We would like to refine the precision and ease of use with mouse mode, and incorporate swiping gestures.

Future work:
Integrate linear classifier and cleaner gestures
